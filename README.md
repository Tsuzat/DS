# DS

Defect Sampling (DS) is a university project. This project is an attempt to detect the surface defects on a steel strip from it's image.

For now, we are using `Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)` to extract the features from the image. The **left singular vectors** and **right singluar vector** are used to produce the left and right projections of the image. The projections are used to determine the potential defects in the image.

## Installation

You can download the [`installer`](https://github.com/Tsuzat/DLDS/releases/download/v.0.0.1-alpha/dlds_setup.exe) or `dlds.zip` file from [releases](https://github.com/Tsuzat/DLDS/releases). Currently, the project is under development and is not ready for production, so you may to face some bugs. Which are recommended to be reported in the issues section.
